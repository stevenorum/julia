Random playing around with Julia.

## Purpose

I want to learn julia.  The sample stuff I put here may also be useful to others.

## Sections

1. [really_basic_stuff](really_basic_stuff/): Exactly what it sounds like.  hello world and all that jazz.
2. [library_example](library_example/): How to create a julia library for use by other code.  Not yet started.
